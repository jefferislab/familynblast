#' NBLAST to identify neuron families and subfamilies
#'
#' This package implements two strategies for predicting the class of neurons
#' based on a training set of neurons. The first strategy using a representation
#' based on dividing the brain into a set of 7065 supervoxels. This strategy is
#' targetd at broad \bold{families} of neurons (think Kenyon cells or the three
#' main classes of Kenyon cell).
#'
#' The second strategy combines the first strategy with the additional use of
#' NBLAST scores for the similarity between test neurons and a training set that
#' has been divided into subfamilies (think a/B core vs surface Kenyon cells).
#'
#' A collection of pre-computed families is distributed based on annotation work
#' carried out on the FlyCircuit single neuron collection.
#'
#' @section Family Models: You can evaluate neurons against an existing family
#'   model using \code{\link{neurons_against_fam}}. You can compute scores
#'   against all families using \code{\link{find_scores_family}} or predict the
#'   family (including the prediction that there is no matching family) for a
#'   list of neurons using \code{\link{find_neurons_family}}.
#'
#'   You can generate new family models using the
#'   \code{\link{create_probab_sv_knowing_fam}} function.
#'
#'   There is pre-computed data distributed with the package for 137 existing
#'   models based on FlyCircuit neurons registered against the FCWB template
#'   brain. See \code{\link{probability_sv_knowing_family}}.
